# Minesweeper-Clone
A clone of Windows Minesweeper.

I'm an amateur high school programmer. Feel free to give me constructive criticism of any kind.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- The goal of the game is to reveal all tiles that are not mines
- Revealing a mine will result in a game loss
- Revealed tiles will have a number on them equal to the number of mines in the eight tiles surrounding them
- Revealing a tile that isn't adjacent to any mines will reveal all tiles surrounding it
- Text fields on the bottom adjust the size of the grid and the total number of mines
- The reset button will start a new game using the values in the text fields

CONTROLS:
- Left click | Reveal tile (as long as it's unflagged)
- Right click | Toggle between an unflagged tile, a flagged tile, and a question mark tile
